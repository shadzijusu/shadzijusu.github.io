              At OVRLAY Labs, I focus on developing web applications using
              Angular and React, and I use Tailwind CSS to style everything and
              keep it clean and responsive. Beyond the frontend, I work with
              GraphQL to ensure fast and efficient communication between the
              website and the server, keeping everything running seamlessly in
              the background. One of the coolest parts of my job is integrating
              3D showrooms into websites using pixel streaming, which lets users
              explore interactive, immersive experiences directly in their
              browser.
              <br /> <br />I also love finding ways to automate repetitive
              tasks, from marketing processes to generating performance reports,
              which helps our team save time and focus on bigger projects.
              Lately, I've been diving into AI, integrating new tools that make
              our applications smarter and more engaging for users.

              I've developed tourism apps using React Native that help people
              explore and learn about some of the most beautiful towns in
              Bosnia. These apps are designed to give users an easy way to
              discover everything a place has to offer, from its historical
              heritage, cultural landmarks, to local tours, activities, and
              where they can stay. I made sure to include images and videos, so
              users can get a real feel for what's available.
              <br /> <br />
              What I loved about this work is that it allowed me to showcase
              Bosnia's hidden gems and make it easier for others to discover
              everything these towns have to offer.

              At P23, I was responsible for budget, payroll, and expenses
              administration. <br />
              I used Excel to keep everything organized, tracking monthly
              expenses like salaries, taxes, and other costs. This system helped
              me easily see what's been paid and what's still outstanding. I've
              also set up charts to visualize the expenses, making it simple to
              monitor spending and stay on top of the budget.
              <br /> <br />
              I've learned a lot about how a startup runs, and it was a great
              opportunity to improve my organizational skills.
