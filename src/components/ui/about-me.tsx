        About Me
      </h1>
      <p className="py-4 max-w-3xl">
        I'm a Frontend Developer with a passion for building beautiful and
        user-friendly web applications. I graduated with a degree in Electrical
        Engineering, focusing on Computing and Informatics, which gave me a
        solid foundation in software development. <br /> <br />
        Currently, I work at Ovrlay Labs, where I develop websites using Angular
        and React. I love making websites that are easy to use and visually
        appealing. Alongside this, I use tools like GraphQL to make sure
        everything runs smoothly in the background. I also enjoy automating
        tasks to make life easier, like setting up systems that handle marketing
        or generate reports. <br /> <br /> As a freelancer, I've been creating
        web and mobile apps for clients, including tourism apps for cultural
        sites. I like solving problems with practical solutions, whether it's
        building a website or integrating new technology into a project. <br />{" "}
        <br />
        Outside of work, I'm passionate about hiking, skiing, and practicing
        yogaâ€”finding a balance between tech and nature. I'm always open to new
        opportunities and collaborations, so feel free to reach out if you'd
        like to work together!
