        About Me
      </h1>
      <p className="pt-4 max-w-3xl text-lg">
        Hi, I'm Selma, a Frontend Developer who loves creating web applications
        that are not only beautiful but also easy to use. I have a degree in
        Electrical Engineering with a focus on Computer Science, which gave me a
        strong base in software development.
        <br /> <br />
        Right now, I'm working at OVRLAY Labs, where I use Angular and React to
        build websites that look great and work smoothly. I also like working
        behind the scenes with tools like GraphQL to keep everything running
        efficiently. Plus, I'm all about automating the boring stuff, like
        marketing tasks or generating reports, to save time and make things
        easier.
        <br /> <br />
        In my freelance work, I've developed both web and mobile apps for
        clients, including tourism apps that help people explore cultural sites.
        I enjoy tackling challenges with practical, real-world solutions,
        whether it's designing a website or figuring out how to integrate new
        tech into a project.
        <br /> <br />
        When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me hiking, skiing, or doing
        yogaâ€”balancing my love for tech with some outdoor adventure. I'm always
        excited to meet new people and collaborate on interesting projects.
